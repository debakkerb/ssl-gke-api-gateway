# Demo Application

The codebase contains a small demo application that exposes two different endpoints:
- /v1/appinfo
- /v1/healthcheck

Functionally there isn't much happening here, but it's just to show an application with multiple endpoints and how they can serve traffic to a Gateway deployed across multiple clusters.

**Disclaimer**

Structure and coding of this application was heavily influenced by the book [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/), written by Alex Edwards.
